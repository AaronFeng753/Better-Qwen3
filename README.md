Auto Thinking Mode switch for Qwen3 in Open webui

---

This is an open webui function for Qwen3 models, it has the following features:
1. Automatically turn on/off the thinking process by using the LLM itself to evaluate the difficulty of your request.
2. Remove model's old thoughts in multi-turn conversation, from Qwen3 model's hugging face README: `In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content.`
